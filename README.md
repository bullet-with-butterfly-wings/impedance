constant - taken straight after mid, constant voltage 2.5V

gain1 - random, same one at the pin
lowg - careless, one at the pin, the second at the electrode, triple at the end, one at the pin causes phase shift
new1 - triple at the beginning, both at the pins
supernew1 - triple at the end, both at the pins, repeatable

Depends on the wire!!!
The long difference of the wire between channels causes a difference
The difference in the wire causes a difference


at the end, some nonlinearity effects

maybe do the square again
